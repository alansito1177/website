<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> I've always been really into computers. In my first year of high school
I began learning how to code C#. We had a project where we could make anything
that we could market so using my little knowledge I managed to make a playable
demo of a top down action rpg game. There was no greater feeling than when I hit play
and everything functioned how I wanted it to. It's a feeling that has stuck with me
and pushes me to want to learn more and make more projects. I'd like to work on projects
with a team to further my knowledge and get feedback on how I can improve.</p>
<p>Outside of coding, I like to:</p>
<!--here i make an unordered list to show all of hobbies outside of coding -->
<ul>
  <li>Play Video Games</li>
  <li>Make Music</li>
  <li>Cook</li>
  <li>Teach my Dog New Tricks</li>
</ul>
